# BIBI

For the past 6 years I've been building server apis,
client side webs, developing application databases, for business
businesses, NGOs and just for humans :). I've done this as an employee,
and a freelancer.
I've also worked and working on some very secret projects and big brands.
I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you...
My favorite stacks are: Nginx, PHP7+, MySQL, Laravel, Bootstrap, VueJS.
